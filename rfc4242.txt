                                RTYPE TRANSFERT PROTOCOL (RTP)

1.   INTRODUCTION

    The R-TYPE project is an multiplayer game project where clients (games) communicate
    and send data via a server. It uses UDP for ingame data and TCP for connection
    information.

2.   STRUCTURE

    The client/server structure is MUST be made as followed:

                                    /----------\       /------\
                                    |  server  |-------|client|
                                    | UDP  TCP |       \------/
                                    \----------/
                                      |      |
                                      |      |
                                      /      \
                                     /        \
                                 /------\    /------\
                                 |client|    |client|
                                 \------/    \------/

    Each client MUST have an UDP and TCP connection to the server.

3.   PROTOCOLS

    3.1   TCP PROTOCOL
        
        The TCP connection MUST only be used by the clients to connect to the server and
        for sending information in the game lobby.
        It MUST send the following structure to communicate:

            struct TCPdata
            {
                TCPEvent event;
                char data[MAX_BODY_LENGTH];
            }
        
        The TCPEvent is an enum and MUST contain the following options:

            - ERROR         -- Inform the receiver that an error occured

            - OK            -- Informs the receiver that his command is successful

            - CONNECT       -- Server->Clients = Someone connected

            - DISCONNECT    -- Client->Server  = The client is disconnecting
                               Server->Clients = Someone is disconnecting

            - START         -- Client->Server  = Starts the game
                            -- Server->Clients = The game is starting

        The data string can contain multiple information, for example : the player username,
        some bytes containing information on the player ship...

        After receiving some data the server MUST respond with an TCPEvent OK or ERROR.
        The client MUST also respond with an TCPEvent OK or ERROR after receiving data
        from the server.

    3.2   UDP PROTOCOL

        The UDP protocol MUST be used to send ingame data.
        It MUST send the following structure to communicate:

            struct UDPMessage
            {
                int playerID;
                int value[10];
                Event event;
            }

        The playerID is the unique ID linked to each player. It is used to differenciate
        players when sending information to other clients.

        The value data is information needed by the server or the client and is linked to the
        event, see next description for more information.

        Event is an enum and MUST contain the following options:

            - MOVE          -- Server->Clients  = Move a sprite
                                value = [posX, posY]
                            -- Client->Server   = Player is moving
                                value = [posX, posY]

            - SHOOT         -- Client->Server   = Player is shooting
                                value = [posX, posY, isStarting=0 or 1]

            - ADD           -- Server->Clients  = A new sprite is created
                                value = [posX, posY, spritePathID, spriteID]

            - REMOVE        -- Server->Clients  = A sprite is removed
                                value = [spriteID]

            - HEALTH        -- Server->Client   = The player health is changing
                                value = [isAdding=0 or 1, value]

            - SCORE         -- Server->Client   = The score of a player is changing
                                value = [isAdding=0 or 1, value]
